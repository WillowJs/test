- finish up todo list

# short term
- come up with demo screencast
- update willow-server to just be express middleware... no need to introduce a new paradigm
- update gulp code to be a gulp plugin


# mid term
- clean up the way that components directories are structured
- only triggering events in certain contexts (from nodes)
